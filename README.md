In the book, an pg 111 take notes. It might just be in the slides. The way a file is printed is called it's formating, ie the appearance.
Formating is a change in attire, not a change in content.

#include <iomanip>  // Required for setw, or, set-width, I'm assuming. 


setw appears to be a method or function, taking an argument. 

< cout << setw(6) << num << setw(6);

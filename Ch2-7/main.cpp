/*
 Assuming the ocean s level is currently rising at about 1.5 millimeters per year , write a program that displays:
 * The number of millimeters higher than the current level that the ocean s level will be in 5 years
 * The number of millimeters higher than the current level that the ocean s level will be in 7 years
 * The number of millimeters higher than the current level that the ocean s level will be in 10 years
